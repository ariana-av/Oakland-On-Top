## Giving Exposure to Oakland Muralists Artists

Our project aims to spotlight the incredible talents of Oakland's muralists! By showcasing their work, we hope to bring more attention to the vibrant art scene in Oakland and provide these artists with the recognition they deserve. This will include creating an online gallery and showcasing murals around OAKLAND!

By highlighting the work of Oakland's muralists, our goal is to create a deeper appreciation for the city's history and diversity.

Our project not only provides a platform for artists to gain visibility but also enhances community pride, hence our “promoting Oakland Pride” motto.  
We believe art has the power to tell stories, provoke thought, and inspire change, and by bringing these murals to the forefront, we emphasize the importance of community identity and social justice. Our choice to spotlight muralists comes from our belief in the value of community and the role of public art in advocating for social justice, especially in Oakland.

Murals often reflect the struggles, dreams, and resilience of the communities they inhabit. By promoting these works, we give a voice to underrepresented artists and ensure that their messages reach a wider audience.
